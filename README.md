# Activation-Function-Exploration: A Repository for Novel Activation Functions

This repository is dedicated to the research and development of new activation functions for artificial neural networks. The main goal of this project is to overcome the challenges that exist in current activation functions, such as vanishing gradients and dying ReLUs, and improve the overall performance of deep learning models.

In this repository, you will find:

Implementation of various new activation functions.
Experiments and test results on various datasets.
Complete documentation of activation functions and research methods.
Contribution guidelines for anyone wishing to participate.
We encourage collaboration and contributions from the machine learning community. Let's explore the potential of new activation functions together and drive progress in deep learning.
